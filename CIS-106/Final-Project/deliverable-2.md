Attached above are the resources i used to complete my project. Overall it was much easier then i expected and i finished it in about an hour. I learned how to use virtual box and setup the network configurations so that my small network would work each other. The only issue i encountered was when I first downloaded the latest version of Ubuntu server 20.04. I was not able to access /etc/network/interfaces because the latest version of ubuntu uses netplan and a different file type. So I deleted all the virtual boxes I created and started again with Ubuntu Server 16.04 from then on I followed the steps outlined in the resources above and was able to create a client pc, router, and server that all could connect to each other internally.
